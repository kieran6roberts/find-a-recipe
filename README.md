## Project Objectives

For this task I wanted to practice my react knowledge by building an app to help users find their next meal. I wanted to incorporate elements of react such as hooks/custom hooks, context and react-routing to improve my comfortability with the library. The site should be responsive, easy to use and have a simple design.

## Technologies
* create-react-app/react 17.0.1
